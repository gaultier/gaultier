# Hello there!

I'm a Software Engineer from France, living in Germany. I also carry DevOps/SRE duties. 

I love systems programming, the lower level it is, the better. I work with Go and C++, and my side projects are usually C or Rust, with some exotic stuff thrown in.

I have a long experience developing, deploying, monitoring and supporting distributed systems that must always run, never break and never slow down. Or very close to it.

Most of my code on Github is experimental, and should likely not be used as such in production. But I'd like experience reports if you use some of it! And if you do want to use it in production and support the effort, get in touch!

I also love Operating Systems and have worked with a number of them. It's always a thrill to experiment with a new one and understand how it has been designed differently from the rest, with different tradeoffs! It's such a special environment with its own constraints.
I'd like to maybe write my own some day.
